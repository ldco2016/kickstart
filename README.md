# kickstart

At the end of the day what I am making here is an Ethereum crowdsale clone similar to this one: https://www.ethereum.org/crowdsale
![](ethereum_crowdsale_clone.png)
This application allows people to browse open campaigns, contribute to them, create campaigns, create requests, everything I put together inside the contract.

Every aspect of this smart contract has some visible feature in the application I am building.

In the diagram above is the landing page for the application I am working on.

It will end up looking quite nice and you will enjoy the styling of the CSS, but for the mockups I am keeping it in diagram form.

At the top is a header that I am calling CrowdCoin.

At the top I have the name of the application, a link that will take the user to a list of all the different campaigns that have been created and a button that the user can click to create a new campaign as well. This is the landing screen that a user will see when they first visit the application.

The user will see a list of all open campaigns that have ever been created and the user can click on the link to view details about a campaign.

On the right hand side the user can click on create campaign button if the user wants to create a new campaign and you will notice the user can click on a campaign twice, both with the `Create Campaign` button and the `+` symbol, this makes it easier for people to create campaigns.

Once the user decides to create a campaign, the application will redirect them to another screen that uses a form like the one you see below:
